# WIP game made with pygame-ce 

## Current controls:

WASD for movement

Left/Right click for Fire/Special fire

ENTER/RETURN for starting the game (from score screen)


## Rules:


You have 3 health points, getting hit by anything removes one of your health points (and gives you brief invulnerability)

You gain score by killing enemies (1 point per flying enemey, 2 points per shooting enemy, and bonus points for MULTI-KILLS)

You are given 1 mid-air jump that resets anytime you kill an enemy 

## Setup:

Ensure you have [Python]([url](www.python.org/downloads/)) installed.

Download pygame-ce with `pip install pygame-ce`.

Run the game!
