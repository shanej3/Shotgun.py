WIP game made with pygame-ce 

Current controls:
WASD for movement
Left/Right click for Fire/Special fire
ESCAPE for starting the game (from score screen)

Rules:
You have 3 lives, getting hit by anything removes one of your hearts (and gives you brief invulnerability)
You gain score by killing enemies (1 point per flying enemey, 2 points per shooting enemy, and bonus points for MULTI-KILLS)

3/22/24: Planning to add a lot more
